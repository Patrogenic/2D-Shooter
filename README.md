# 2D-Shooter
## Run Project
To run the project (assuming you have java installed):  
1: Download 'dist_zipped.zip'
2: Unzip the file and run '2D Shooter.jar' 

## Controls
WASD keys to move  
Mouse to point and shoot  
R to reload  
Esc to pause

## Advice/Tips
1: You can only hold one gun.  
2: Ammo is infinite.  
3: You stand on a pad to purchase an item.  
4: Some perks have more than one level.  
5: Look for secret passages to progress.  
6: There is no end to the game.  
7: When you die, your kills and time spent alive will be reported.  
8: You can save the game into a .txt file in the pause menu.  
9: Some aspects of the game rely on randomization. If you find yourself getting good luck in a game, be sure to save. That file will continue to exist after you die, but will be overwritten by hitting save again.  

## Notes
This is a project I made in 2017 in high school. It's not technically complete or polished, but it is what it is and as it stands, it's certainly a game. It's fair to say that aspects of the game are not balanced very well. There isn't too much to the game currently. If you play a solid 10-15 minute game, you'll have explored basically all the game's functionality. So aim to last 10 minutes and get 200 kills and consider that a win!
