# 2D-Shooter
## Run Project
To run the project (assuming you have java installed):  
1: Download the /dist folder and run the "2D Shooter.jar" file  
or  
2: While inside the /dist directory run the command java -jar "2D Shooter.jar"

WASD keys to move  
Mouse to point and shoot

## Advice/Tips
1: You can only hold one gun.  
2: Ammo is infinite  
3: You stand on a pad to purchase an item. 
4: Some perks have more than one level
5: Look for secret passages to progress.  
6: There is no end to the game.  
7: When you die, your kills and time spent alive will be reported.  
8: You can save the game into a .txt file in the pause menu.  
9: Some aspects of the game rely on randomization. If you find yourself getting good luck in a game, be sure to save. That file will continue to exist after you die, but will be overwritten by hitting save again.  

## Notes
This is a project I made in 2017 in high school.
